No need to be super fast
Easy to use, somewhat powerful
- but how to make it useful 
  (declarative mini language maybe ?)

Correct
 - layers
 - one internal representation and conversions later

So organize by phases:

HOWABOUT MAKING TEST CASES
- which makes us think about the actual use

- Syntactic format checking (tabularity)
- Transposition to var per row
- Conversion from separators to TABS
- Split varnames and rest (if varnames in first row)
- Gen varnames if necessary
- Semantic format checking - i.e. varnames
- Variable selection
- Missing data reporting
- Missing data to ''
- Value range definition
- Analysis - conversion cycle
- Discretization
- Imputation
- Alphizing
- Transposing
- Adding varnames
